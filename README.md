# Project-2

This is full stack web application designed to allow parents to connect regarding issues surrounding their children's online education during the COVID-19 pandemic. It allows parents to post resources and questions, search posts, as well as filter posts by type, grade, school, and district. The application uses an express server, as well as passport and bcrypt packages for authentication and sessions. The Sequlize ORM is used to create User and Post models. The front-end is built using Bootstrap and the Handlebars framework. Javascript on the front-end dynamically reloads the dashboard each time the posts are filtered. The API routes pass data from MySQL using Sequelize queries.
